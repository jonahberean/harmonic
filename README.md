Harmonic field test
=============

This test uses a magnetic field generated from a harmonic polynomial expansion.
It then runs PENTrack to print a cut through the field.

In the notebook, testing_notebook.ipynb, a series of test cuts are presented and
discussed. This aims to validate the implementation of the `harmonicfields` class.

Run RunTest.sh to run the test.
